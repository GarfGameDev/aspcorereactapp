# ASP .NET Core React App
This project is an example of using React for the front end and ASP .NET for the backend, it's quite barebones at the moment but it's a good opportunity to add to it like a navbar with routing. It seems that Visual Studio's base project for React and ASP is a lot less than what they used to have which did have basic routing and a navbar.
