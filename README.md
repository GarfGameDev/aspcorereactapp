# ASP .NET Core React App
This project is an example of using React for the front end and ASP .NET for the backend, it's quite barebones at the moment but it's a good opportunity to add to it like a navbar with routing. It seems that Visual Studio's base project for React and ASP is a lot less than what they used to have which did have basic routing and a navbar.

I've also been using this project as an example on creating seperate branches and pull requests for merging them back into the master branch while working on different components of the app.

One thing that's been implemented now is the weather forecast page that used the randomised data from the api call to the backend and displays it dynamically in customised weather widgets.
